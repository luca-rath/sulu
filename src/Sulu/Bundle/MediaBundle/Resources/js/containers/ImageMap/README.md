The `ImageMap` container is a combination of a `SingleMediaSelection` and a form. It allows defining an arbitrary amount
of hotspot areas on the selected image and assigning values to each of those hotspots. A hotspot can be either of type
`Rectangle`, `Circle` or `Point`. It's up to the developer which fields are available to be filled out by content editors.
